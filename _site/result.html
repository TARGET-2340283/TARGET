        <h2 id="significant-results">Significant Results:</h2>

<h3 id="results-of-activity-1-gnn-with-reparameterization-for-joint-beamforming-and-integer-user-association">Results of Activity 1: GNN with Reparameterization for Joint Beamforming and Integer User Association</h3>
<p>Original Paragraphs: {We compare the sum-rate convergence of our STGS-based GNN (which directly outputs integer associations) against a Softmax-based GNN (which produces probabilistic associations). Our results show that STGS significantly outperforms Softmax, as it enforces integer outputs while retaining gradients for backpropagation, leading to better sum-rate optimization.</p>

<p>We further evaluate the generalization ability to a larger number of UEs for two Gumbel reparameterization methods: (a) Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax (STGS), which guarantees integer associations while maintaining differentiability; and (b) GumbelSoftmax (GS), which produces near-integer outputs while encouraging exploration. For moderate UE counts, STGS achieves better generalization, while for larger networks (30+ UEs), GS slightly surpasses STGS, as its non-integer outputs allow for better exploration and learning. Both methods introduce Gumbel noise to improve resource allocation in congested networks. In contrast, Softmax alone degrades in generalization performance as the number of UEs increases due to its lack of integer enforcement.}</p>

<p>We compare the sum-rate convergence of our STGS-based GNN (which outputs integer associations) with a Softmax-based GNN (which yields probabilistic outputs). STGS outperforms Softmax with better sum-rate optimization.</p>

<p>We also assess generalization to more UEs using two Gumbel-based methods: (a) STGS, which ensures integer outputs and differentiability, and (b) GumbelSoftmax (GS), which offers near-integer outputs with better exploration. STGS generalizes better for moderate UE counts, while GS performs slightly better for large networks (30+ UEs) due to its flexibility. Both use Gumbel noise to enhance resource allocation, unlike Softmax, which struggles with scalability due to its non-discrete outputs.</p>

<h3 id="results-of-activity-2--3-comparing-attention-based-gnn-and-dual-optimization-for-user-association">Results of Activity 2 &amp; 3 Comparing Attention-based GNN and Dual Optimization for User Association:</h3>
<p>Original Paragraphs: {Our results show that the proposed attention-based GNN structure with GS reparameterization and SK normalization achieves excellent sum-rate convergence, converging to a sum rate value much higher than other methods, such as softmax for association output, and approaching closely to the sum rate achieved by exhaustive search in cases where such a search is possible.</p>

<p>Next, we evaluate the generalization ability of different methods with respect to the number of UEs, while comparing to an optimal benchmark using exhaustive search for the association decision. The results show that our proposed GNN structure achieves near-optimal performance and generalizes well with more UEs, consistently maintaining its superior performance compared to other practical baselines. The dual association method also achieves near-optimal performance at low numbers of UEs, but degrades significantly with more UEs. This suggests that the GNN learning by leveraging learning-based representations is better equipped to adapt to varying network density/size and layout configurations. In contrast, the dual optimization, being a traditional optimization-based approach, lacks the flexibility to generalize effectively in more complex and dynamic network scenarios.</p>

<p>Since our GNN-based association solution can sometimes violate the load balancing constraint (before the rebalancing process), we also examined the violation ratio and compared that to other GNN solutions using softmax. We showed that our GNN solution only violates the load balancing approximately 10% of the channel realizations, while the softmax solution consistently violates load balancing almost 100%, as in this solution, all UEs tend to connect to the same BS, leading to persistent overloading. These results highlight the effectiveness of our SKGS method in promoting balanced associations and satisfying the quota constraints across the BSs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we evaluate the generalization ability of our proposed methods to different BS transmit power levels (i.e., SNRs) and demonstrate that all our proposed association solutions scale well with SNR. This generalization holds for both the GNN-based and the dual-based solutions}</p>

<p>Our attention-based GNN with GS reparameterization and SK normalization achieves superior sum-rate convergence, nearing the performance of exhaustive search and outperforming softmax-based methods. In generalization tests with varying UE counts, our GNN consistently delivers near-optimal results, outperforming practical baselines. While the dual method performs well at low UE counts, its performance drops with more UEs, highlighting the GNN’s adaptability to changing network conditions by leveraging learning-based representations. Although our GNN may initially violate load balancing constraints, it does so in only ~10% of cases—far better than softmax-based GNNs, which nearly always overload a single BS. This underscores SKGS’s effectiveness in maintaining balanced associations. Finally, our methods generalize well across different BS transmit power levels (SNRs), with both GNN and dual-based approaches scaling effectively.</p>

<h3 id="results-of-activity-4--joint-congestion-control-and-flow-optimization-with-percentile-based-delay-constraints">Results of Activity 4:  Joint Congestion Control and Flow Optimization with Percentile-Based Delay Constraints</h3>
<p>Directly solving the joint congestion control and flow optimization problem with percentile-based delay constraints is challenging. To address this, we reformulate the problem using a sufficient condition relaxation, replacing the original end-to-end delay constraints with stronger but more tractable sufficient conditions. This relaxed formulation transforms the problem into a convex optimization problem.</p>

<p>By incorporating the end-to-end delay constraints as barrier functions, the optimization becomes a convex problem defined over the Cartesian product of simplex constraints. Using the barrier method, we iteratively solve the optimization problem with a fixed barrier parameter and gradually decrease this parameter over time. We used the distributive projection gradient method and the centralized Newton method to solve the problem under a fixed barrier parameter. Both methods ensure the solution remains feasible at each iteration, provided the initial starting point is feasible.</p>

<h3 id="results-of-activity-5-delay-optimal-service-chain-forwarding-and-offloading-in-collaborative-edge-computing">Results of Activity 5: Delay-Optimal Service Chain Forwarding and Offloading in Collaborative Edge Computing</h3>
<p>We solve the non-convex optimization problem globally by analyzing the KKT condition and proposing a sufficient condition for optimality. We then develop a distributed algorithm that converges to the global optimum. The algorithm adapts to changes in input rates and network topology, and can be implemented as an online algorithm. Numerical evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms baselines in multiple network instances, especially in congested scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="results-of-activity-6-cost-aware-joint-caching-and-forwarding-in-networks-with-heterogeneous-cache-resources">Results of Activity 6: Cost-aware Joint Caching and Forwarding in Networks with Heterogeneous Cache Resources</h3>
<p>Our work models the cache as a set of storage blocks with varying rate parameters and utilization costs. Utilizing a framework that enables joint caching and forwarding, we introduce an optimization technique based on the drift-plus-penalty method. Our approach minimizes the drift-plus-penalty expression in a virtual control plane and offers a throughput-cache utilization cost trade-off. We implement a corresponding practical policy in the data plane. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in total delay and cache utilization costs.</p>

<h3 id="results-of-activity-7-measurement-based-study-of-beam-management-in-operational-5g-mmwave-networks">Results of Activity 7: Measurement-based study of beam management in operational 5G mmWave networks</h3>
<p>The main results of our study are summarized as follows: 
Commercial 5G gNBs and UEs use only a small subset of available beams and switch beams infrequently (every 0.6-2.8 s), influenced by beamwidth, vendor-specific 3D beamforming, and motion type.</p>

<p>Narrow beams generally result in better link quality, support higher and more stable MCS, and provide higher throughput in spite of more frequent beam changes compared to wide beams. In contrast, gNBs featuring wide beams rely heavily on RA to deal with changes in link quality during motion.
UEs send beam measurement reports every 160-310 ms on average, but many of these reports do not trigger beam changes on the gNBs, suggesting that there is scope for improvement with respect to the signaling overhead.</p>

<p>Proprietary gNB algorithms select near-optimal beams over 90% of the time, typically within 1-2 dB of the best possible beam.</p>

<p>Unlike IEEE 802.11ad, 5G mmWave gNBs perform beam measurement and selection per carrier,  even though this is not mandated by 3GPP. Our analysis suggests that this choice is often justified, showing high frequency selectivity even for adjacent carriers just 100 MHz apart.</p>

<p>Beam refinement improves signal strength but increases overhead and may degrade performance under self-blockage or high mobility. gNBs with many beams and no refinement can achieve better throughput by avoiding this overhead.</p>

<h3 id="results-of-activity-8-a-research-agenda-for-spatial-video-streaming">Results of Activity 8: A research agenda for spatial video streaming</h3>
<p>We obtained preliminary results using an iPhone and Vision Pro XR headset. We developed a spatial video player app for Vision Pro, which includes features like stereoscopic playback and user rating interfaces designed with simple interactions, and conducted a subjective user study on user preferences for mono and spatial videos encoded with the same bitrate ladder. Our main results are summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can perceive depth in both mono and spatial videos when viewed on the VisionPro headset, with spatial videos consistently achieving higher experience for depth perception.</li>
  <li>Visual quality is higher for mono videos over spatial videos across various bitrates. This preference can be attributed to the fact that compressing mono videos, which contain only one view, allocates more bitrate for quality improvement, thereby enhancing visual quality perception.</li>
  <li>We observe a notable shift in overall QoE from low to high bitrates. At lower bitrates (e.g., 1 Mbps and 5 Mbps), users favor mono videos over spatial videos. However, this preference shifts towards spatial videos at higher bitrates. Such a finding introduces new research problems for spatial video adaptive streaming in order to achieve the best QoE: whether to prioritize streaming stereoscopic videos at low quality or opt for monocular videos with relatively higher quality.</li>
</ul>
