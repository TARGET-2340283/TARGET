The proposed research will lay the theoretical foundations for enabling high-quality AR/VR/MR apps, which are
highly anticipated by the society, as it braces for the wide deployment of 5G and Beyond mobile networks. The PIs
will discuss research findings at various industry-focused venues that are not typically open to academics and they
will leverage the strong ties of the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things with industry to share the results and
ideas with industry affiliate researchers. All the source codes and datasets from the project will be made publicly available. The
project findings will offer materials for integration in several classes taught by the PIs at Northeastern and Tufts.

## The impact on the development of the principal discipline(s)
The project directly contributes to the technical/algorithmic development of modern wireless systems and networks, including beyond 5G and 6G systems, particularly in enhancing wireless network data rate and reducing the overall latency. The project also contributes to the research and design methodology for future wireless networks, expanding the application of various deep-learning architectures such as graph neural networks. 

## The impact on other disciplines
The project extended the applications of optimization and machine learning methods to the field of communications and networks. 

## The impact on the development of human resources
The project provided extensive training for PhD students, who will contribute to the highly skilled human resources in engineering and technology. 

## The impact on teaching and educational experiences
The project provided extracurricular knowledge and examples for courses taught by the PI, including Convex Optimization and Communication Systems. 

Results from the study on beam management have been included in Co-PI Koutsonikolas’s graduate course EECE 7364 “Mobile and Wireless Networks”, which covers 5G among other topics.

## The impact on physical resources that form infrastructure
The project has direct impacts on 6G systems, which form an important information technology infrastructure
