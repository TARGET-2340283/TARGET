The proposed research will lay the theoretical foundations for enabling high-quality AR/VR/MR apps, which are highly anticipated by the society, as it braces for the wide deployment of 5G and Beyond mobile networks. The PIs will discuss research findings at various industry-focused venues that are not typically open to academics and they will leverage the strong ties of the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things with industry to share the results and ideas with industry affiliate researchers. All the source codes and datasets from the project will be made publicly available. The project findings will offer materials for integration in several classes taught by the PIs at Northeastern and Tufts.
