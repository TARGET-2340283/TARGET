## Results dissemination and outreach to the community.
Beyond regularly publishing in conferences and journals, the PIs will discuss research findings at various industry-focused venues that are not typically open to academics, such as the 6G Symposium, Informa Big5G event, and Mobile World Congress. PI Yeh and Co-PI Koutsonikolas have active research collaborations with AT\&T, Cisco, HP Labs, Bell Labs, and American Tower on related research topics. Additionally, Yeh and Koutsonikolas are members of the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things (WIoT) and will leverage the Institute's strong ties with industry to share the results and ideas with industry affiliate researchers. WIoT has recently launched Open6G, an industry-university cooperative research and development center that includes key players in the 5G mmWave technology and edge-based computing --  Interdigital, Keysight, AT\&T, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mavenir, MITRE, Raytheon, and Red Hat.

## Recruitment of Under-represented Groups and Outreach.
The PIs have an excellent track record of supervising students and postdocs from under-represented minority (URM) groups.  PI Yeh has actively promoted the careers of women researchers within his research group. All four of his postdoctoral fellows have been women, three of whom (Ying Cui, Derya Malak and Qian Ma) are successful tenure-track faculty members.
Co-PI~Koutsonikolas has supervised one URM undergraduate research student (see above) and nine female graduate students (six at UB and three at NU). Among them, Piyali Banerjee won the CSE Best MS Research Award at the University at UB in 2020 and Yunmeng Han is joining the PhD program at the University of Cincinnati in Fall 2023. PI Vu has been advising six female PhD students in her group, where three have graduated with a PhD degree. 
The PIs are dedicated to continuing their efforts of recruiting women
and URM students through outreach activities at NU and Tufts.
