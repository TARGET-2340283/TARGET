The project spans both theoretical and experimental research across all layers of the networking protocol stack. 
As such, project findings will offer materials for integration in several classes
taught by the PIs at NU and Tufts. PI Yeh teaches a course on "Analysis and Design of Data Networks", which covers advanced topics on caching and computation scheduling. He also teaches the well-attended “Numerical Optimization Methods” and "Introduction to Machine Learning" courses, which have in-depth coverage of optimization and machine learning theory and algorithms. Co-PI Koutsonikolas offers a project-oriented graduate course "Wireless Network Systems and Applications" every Spring semester, which provides excellent opportunities for introducing the outcomes of this project (systems, networking, ML). Results from the study on beam management have been included in his graduate course EECE 7364 "Mobile and Wireless Networks", which covers 5G among other topics.
He also teaches introductory courses to networking, in which he introduces mmWave and edge computing as emerging technologies. 
The project will also provide course project opportunities for Convex Optimization taught by PI Vu at Tufts.
