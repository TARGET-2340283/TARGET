This project is a collaborative effort between Tufts University (PI Vu) and Northeastern University (PI Edmund Yeh and coPI Dimitrios Koutsonikolas). Our Tufts team focuses primarily on the physical layer with beamforming and user association design, whereas the Northeastern teams focus more on the network layer, including caching and computation algorithm design, together with experimentation. We plan to have yearly all-hands project meetings and other informal exchanges, made easier by the proximity between the two institutions. In later reporting periods, we will also aim to integrate the results from the different layers to provide a cross-layer solution. 

Co-PI Koutsonikolas and Phuc Dinh collaborated with Hamza Bouchebbah (Kaizen Tech, Japan) on the study of beam management in operational 5G networks.

Co-PI Koutsonikolas and Sizhe Wang collaborated with Prof. Mallesham Dasari (Northeastern) and his student and with Prof. Jacob Chakareski (NJIT) on the work on spatial video streaming.

PI Edmund Yeh and Yuanhao Wu collaborated with a postdoc, Jinkun Zhang (Imperial College London), on joint congestion control and flow optimization with percentile-based delay constraints.
