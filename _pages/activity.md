## Major Activities:  

### Activity 1: GNN with Reparameterization for Joint Beamforming and Integer User Association
To jointly optimize continuous beamforming and integer user association, we introduced reparameterization methods into GNN structures by utilizing Gumbel-Softmax (GS) parameterization and Straight-Through coding. Such reparameterization enables nearinteger or strictly integer association decisions without relying on probability-based outputs or relaxation techniques. Our reparameterized model maintains strong scalability and generalization ability across network sizes and transmit power levels, and achieves superior network sum rates compared to existing integer relaxation methods.
### Activity 2: Attention-based GNN for User Association with Rebalancing Architecture
We propose a novel attention-based GNN architecture to optimize user association decisions in wireless networks while also using GS parameterization as above for integer decisions. We adapted the attention mechanism from the Transformer architecture as a key component in our GNN edge-update process to capture the varying degrees of importance of the different links between a UE and BS nodes. The attention mechanism allows the GNN model to accurately capture the heterogeneity of wireless channel conditions and network topology, significantly improving the resulting association decisions' throughput performance. 
To further improve the fairness and balance of user associations, we integrate the Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) algorithm to promote more equitable load distribution among BSs and mitigate the risk of overloading any individual BS. By integrating these advanced techniques—attention-based edge updates, GS reparameterization, and SK normalization—our GNN architecture not only enables effective and scalable user association but also achieves near-balanced resource utilization across the network.
For cases when the GNN association output is not fully load balanced, we further refine the decision through a novel rebalancing algorithm based on worst connection reassigning (WCR), which then guarantees load balancing at every BS. These enhancements make our approach particularly effective in dense and dynamic wireless environments, where adaptive and robust decision-making is essential.

### Activity 3:  Dual Optimization for Load-Balanced User Association
As an alternative, we also explored traditional optimization methods and proposed a low-complexity distributed algorithm that efficiently computes user association decisions in wireless networks while guaranteeing load balancing. The algorithm is designed to converge to a near-optimal solution that satisfies two critical requirements: (1) Integer user association outputs, which ensure that each user is associated with exactly one BS, and (2) Load-balanced allocation, which guarantees that the number of users assigned to each BS is only up to that BS's predefined quota constraints. By operating in a distributed manner, the algorithm enables each BS to make local decisions based on partial network information, significantly reducing communication overhead and computation burden compared to centralized solutions. This makes our method scalable and practical for large-scale or dense networks, where centralized approaches become infeasible. 

### Activity 4: Joint Congestion Control and Flow Optimization with Percentile-Based Delay Constraints
Original paragraph {In this activity, we develop new iterative algorithms to solve a joint congestion control and flow optimization problem over a multi-hop network with arbitrary topology. We begin with a static wireline network and then extend our model to the wireless case. In our model, users generate data requests for various datasets stored in the network. These requests are admitted into the network based on a congestion control mechanism. Each request type is identified by a category index w, determined by its source-destination node pair.
Our algorithm manages both the admission rates and the forwarding of network flows to ensure that all request types meet specific end-to-end delay constraints based on percentiles. For a request type w, the delay constraint requires that at least a fraction s(w) of the requests be fulfilled within a time limit T(w).
We use a link-centric model tailored for data-intensive networks, focusing on M/M/1 queuing delays at network links. The proposed algorithm simultaneously maximizes the total concave utility of the admission rates and minimizes the total convex cost of link flows, achieving an optimal balance. We solve a relaxed version of the problem under sufficient conditions that guarantee compliance with the specified percentile-based delay constraints.}

### Activity 5: Delay-Optimal Service Chain Forwarding and Offloading in Collaborative Edge Computing 
Collaborative edge computing (CEC) is an emerging paradigm for heterogeneous devices to collaborate on edge computation jobs. For congestible links and computing units, delay-optimal forwarding and offloading for service chain tasks (e.g., DNN with vertical split) in CEC remains an open problem. In our work, we formulate the service chain forwarding and offloading problem in CEC with arbitrary topology and heterogeneous transmission/computation capability, and aim to minimize the aggregated network cost. We consider congestion-aware non-linear cost functions that cover various performance metrics and constraints, such as average queueing delay with limited processor capacity.

### Activity 6: Cost-aware Joint Caching and Forwarding in Networks with Heterogeneous Cache Resources
Caching is vital for high-throughput networks in data-intensive applications and can dramatically reduce the latency when deployed at the wireless edge network. Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), often used for caching due to its high data transfer rate, faces limitations in capacity and cost, hindering scalability needed to meet growing demand. Evolving flash storage can augment DRAM, but necessitates caching techniques adapted to its characteristics for optimal network performance. Our work models the cache as a set of storage blocks with varying rate parameters and utilization costs. Utilizing a framework that enables joint caching and forwarding, we introduce an optimization technique based on the drift-plus-penalty method. 

###  Activity 7: Measurement-based study of beam management in operational 5G mmWave networks 
We conducted the first in-depth empirical study of beam management procedures in commercial 5G mmWave networks. Our study is based on an extensive measurement campaign across two major US operators, covering six cities, different base station types, different UE devices, and varying mobility scenarios, including walking and driving. We evaluated key beam management parameters on both the base station and the user equipment side, assessing their impact on network performance. In addition, we examined the interaction between beam management and two other mechanisms critical to performance, rate adaptation and carrier aggregation. Finally, we quantified the beamforming overhead and analyzed the effectiveness of beam tracking.

### Activity 8: A research agenda for spatial video streaming 
Spatial videos provide depth perception by presenting two slightly different perspectives of the same scene to the viewer’s left and right eyes, creating new possibilities for AR/VR/XR applications. Spatial videos are captured with two time-synchronized cameras with a small horizontal distance between the cameras, emulating the binocular 3D human vision. Unlike other forms of 3D content, such as 360-degree videos and volumetric videos, spatial 3D videos consist of two 2D video streams that together create a 3D effect. However, streaming spatial videos encounters several challenges, such as bandwidth limitations, latency, and synchronization issues between multiple camera views. We conducted a preliminary study of spatial video streaming on the Apple Vision Pro XR Headset and created a comprehensive research agenda to address these issues and make spatial video streaming as ubiquitous as traditional online video for mobile systems and applications.
